- $0 on 3 seeds sprouted

I place the remaining $5 on the possibility of 2 seeds sprouting just in case there was a delay in sprouting or an error in Jim's observation. But with Jim's statement, there's virtually no reason to believe that 0 or 3 seeds have sprouted.","Response: Yes, given the context, it appears that Jim knows exactly how many of the 3 seeds have sprouted as he has stated that he has looked at all 3 seeds and reported that 1 of them has sprouted.",3,0,95,5,0,Y,,,,
50,exams,Students in the introductory bio class almost always have passing grades on the exam.<br> Mark's 3 intro bio students took an exam yesterday.,How many of the 3 exams do you think have passing grades?,Mark tells you on the phone: 'I have looked at 3 of the 3 exams. 1 of the exams has passing grades.',Now how many of the 3 exams do you think have passing grades?,Do you think Mark knows exactly how many of the 3 exams have passing grades?,3,1,"Based on the context, it is likely that all 3 of Mark's intro bio students have passing grades on the exam.","Based on Mark's statement, it is confirmed that one of the exams has a passing grade. As for the other two, we don't have any information. So, my bets would be:

- $0 on 0 exams with passing grades
- $65 on 1 exam with passing grades
- $25 on 2 exams with passing grades
- $10 on 3 exams with passing grades

While the initial context suggests that it's likely all students pass, Mark's statement introduces some uncertainty about the other two exams. Therefore, I would bet most heavily on 1, but still allocate a smaller amount on 2 and 3 to account for the possibility that the other students also passed.","Response: Yes, since Mark stated that he has looked at all 3 of the exams, it is certain that he knows exactly how many of the 3 exams have passing grades.",3,0,65,25,10,Y,,,,
50,letters,Letters to Laura's company almost always have checks inside.<br> Today Laura received 3 letters.,How many of the 3 letters do you think have checks inside?,Laura tells you on the phone: 'I have looked at 3 of the 3 letters. 2 of the letters have checks inside.',Now how many of the 3 letters do you think have checks inside?,Do you think Laura knows exactly how many of the 3 letters have checks inside?,3,2,"Based on the context, it is likely that all 3 letters Laura received today have checks inside.","Based on Laura's statement, I am confident that 2 of the 3 letters have checks inside. So, I would divide the money as follows:

- $0 on option 0 
- $0 on option 1 
- $100 on option 2 
- $0 on option 3 

This distribution indicates my full confidence that 2 out of the 3 letters have checks inside.","Response: Yes, Laura knows exactly how many of the 3 letters have checks inside. She stated that she has looked at all 3 letters and found checks in 2 of them.",3,0,0,100,0,Y,,,,
50,tickets,Tickets in the DoubleDay instant lottery almost always win.<br> Joe bought 3 DoubleDay tickets yesterday.,How many of the 3 tickets do you think have won?,Joe tells you on the phone: 'I have looked at 1 of the 3 tickets. 1 of the tickets has won.',Now how many of the 3 tickets do you think have won?,Do you think Joe knows exactly how many of the 3 tickets have won?,1,1,"Based on the context that DoubleDay instant lottery tickets almost always win, it is highly likely that all 3 tickets that Joe bought have won.","Based on Joe's statement, we know for sure that at least 1 of the tickets has won. However, considering the context that DoubleDay instant lottery tickets almost always win, it's still likely that the other 2 tickets have won as well. 

Here's how I would divide the $100:
- 0 tickets won: $0 (we know at least 1 ticket has won)
- 1 ticket won: $20 (just to account for uncertainty)
- 2 tickets won: $30 (there is a chance that one of the remaining tickets didn't win)
- 3 tickets won: $50 (given the high probability of winning, it is most likely that all tickets have won)","Response: Based on Joe's statement, it seems that Joe only knows for sure that 1 of the 3 tickets has won because he has looked at only 1 of them. He hasn't mentioned checking the other 2 tickets. Therefore, it's likely that he does not know exactly how many of the 3 tickets have won.",3,0,20,30,50,N,,,,

$0 on 0 - Monica has already confirmed that 2 out of the 3 fruits have dried out pith.
$10 on 1 - Since 2 fruits have been confirmed to have dried out pith, there is a very small probability that only 1 fruit has dried out pith. This would only be possible if Monica made an error.
$20 on 2 - Although Monica confirmed 2 fruits have dried out pith, she has not checked the third one yet. However, given the information that Mongines almost always have dried out pith, this is less likely.
$70 on 3 - Considering the fact that Mongines almost always have","Response: No, Monica does not know exactly how many of the 3 fruits have dried out pith. She has only checked 2 out of the 3 fruits so far.",3,0,10,20,70?,N,drop_incomplete,,,

Therefore, it is highly likely that all three phones have burned out transistors, but it's not certain.","Response: Given Ben's statement, it's confirmed that all three phones have burned out transistors. Therefore, I would bet $100 on 3, indicating my full confidence, and $0 on 0, 1, and 2.","Response: Yes, since Ben has examined all three phones and stated that all of them have burned out transistors, it's clear that he knows exactly how many of the phones have this specific issue.",3?,0,0,0,100,Y,,drop_wrongPrior,,

We also know that Jim has not checked the third seed yet. Given the information that Corendula seeds almost always sprout within a day when put into water, it's highly likely that the third seed has also sprouted. Here is how I would divide the $100 to indicate my confidence:

- 0 seeds sprouted: $0 (we know this is not the case because at least 1 seed has sprouted)
- 1 seed sprouted: $10 (it's possible, but unlikely, that the remaining seed has not sprouted)
